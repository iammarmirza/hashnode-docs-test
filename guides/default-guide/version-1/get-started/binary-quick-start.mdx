This page shows you how to quickly get started with Parseable, by downloading and running the Parseable executable binary. We'll start Parseable server in `local-store` mode, and then insert and read some sample data using SQL.

### Start Parseable

Download the relevant binary and start Parseable in `local-store` mode with the following commands:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://logg.ing/install | bash
parseable local-store
```

<Callout type="tip">
Parseable listens on the port 8000. You can access Parseable UI at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). The default credentials are `admin` and `admin`.
</Callout>

### Ingest log data

Send your first log event to the log stream `demo` using below command.

```bash
curl --location --request POST \
'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ingest' \
--header 'X-P-META-meta1: value1' \
--header 'X-P-TAG-tag1: value1' \
--header 'X-P-Stream: demo' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '[
    {
        "id": "434a5f5e-2f5f-11ed-a261-0242ac120002",
        "datetime": "2023-01-05T07:20:50.52Z",
        "host": "153.10.110.81",
        "user-identifier": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) Firefox/64.0",
        "method": "PUT",
        "status": 500,
        "referrer": "http://www.google.com/"
    }
]'
```

Parseable uses log streams to organize log data. Here we posted a sample log data to the log stream `demo`, by adding the header `X-P-Stream: demo` in the request.

We also added metadata and tags to the log event with `X-P-META-` and `X-P-TAG-` headers in the request. For example, the below command adds `meta1=value1` and `tag1=value1` to the log event. It also posts a sample log data to the log stream `demo`.

Metadata is primarily used for defining extra information for a log event, while tags are used for organizing events. For example, `severity=warn` and `severity=error` are good examples of metadata, while `environment=prod` and `environment=dev` are good examples of tags.

### Query log data

To query the data via Console, login at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and select the log stream `demo` and correct time stamp.
