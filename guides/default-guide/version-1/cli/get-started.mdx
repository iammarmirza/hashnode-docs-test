## Installation

Download the latest [release from GitHub](https://github.com/parseablehq/pb/releases/latest) for your OS. Extract the contents of the tar file, and move the `pb` binary to a location in your `$PATH`. For example:

```bash
wget https://github.com/parseablehq/pb/releases/download/v0.4.0/pb_0.4.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf pb_0.4.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
chmod +x pb
mv pb /usr/local/bin
```

You can also use `pb` with Docker. For example, to run the `pb stream list` command in a Docker container:

```bash
docker run parseable/pb stream list
```

This will list all the streams in the default profile i.e. demo that points to the [Demo Parseable Server](https://demo.parseable.com).

## Profile

A profile is a named configuration for connecting to a Parseable Server. ``pb` ships with a profile called `demo` which points to the [Demo Parseable Server](https://demo.parseable.com). `pb` can be used to configure several profiles.

Profile command has the following sub-commands:

### add

You can create a new profile by running the `pb profile create` command. For example:

```bash
pb profile add mydemo https://demo.parseable.com admin admin
```

### list

List add the profiles by running the `pb profile list` command. For example:

```bash
pb profile list
```

### default

To avoid setting the a profile for every command, you can set the default profile by running the `pb profile default` command. For example:

```bash
pb profile default mydemo
```

By default the `demo` profile is set as the default profile.

### delete

You can delete a profile by running the `pb profile delete` command. For example:

```bash
pb profile delete mydemo
```

## Stream Management

A stream is a collection of log events. `pb` can be used to manage streams on a Parseable server. Stream command has the following sub-commands:

### add

You can create a new stream by running the `pb stream add` command. For example:

```bash
pb stream add teststream
```

### info

You can get information about a stream by running the `pb stream info` command. For example:

```bash
pb stream info frontend
```

### list 

You can list all the streams by running the `pb stream list` command. For example:

```bash
pb stream list
```

### remove

You can remove a stream by running the `pb stream remove` command. For example:

```bash
pb stream remove teststream
```

## Version

Version command helps you get the version of `pb` instance and the connected Parseable server. 

```
pb version
```
