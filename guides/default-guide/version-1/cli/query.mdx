## Query

To query log data on Parseable, you can use the `pb query` command.

```bash
pb query run "select * from frontend limit 50" --from=1m --to=now
```

You can also pipe the query output to other familiar tools like `jq`, `grep`, `cut`, `awk`, `sed` etc to process the JSON output. For example:

```bash
pb query run "select * from frontend" --from=1m --to=now | jq . | less
pb query run "select host, id, method, status from frontend where status = 500" --from=1m --to=now | jq . | less
pb query run "select host, id, method, status from frontend where status = 500" --from=1m --to=now | grep "POST" | jq . | less
```

### Supported flags

Below are the flags supported by `query` command.

- `from` or `f`: Used to specify the start time of the query. Takes date as '2023-10-12T07:20:50.52Z' or string like '10m', '1hr'. Default value is '1m'.
- `to` or `t`: Used to specify the end time of the query. Takes date as '2023-10-12T07:20:50.52Z' or 'now'. Default value is 'now'.
- `save-as` or `s`: Used to save a filter with the specified query. Takes a filter name.
- `with-time` or `w` : To store the filter along with the specified time range chain `save-as` or `s` flag with `with-time` or `w` flag.

### Manage Filters

To manage the saved filters for the active user you can use the `list` command. For example:

```bash
pb query list
```

This will open an interactive TUI which will show the available filters along with options for applying and deleting.

## Live Tail

`pb` allows live tailing log events as well. `pb` hooks on to the Parseable websocket endpoint and streams the log events to the terminal. Streaming live tail events is as simple as running the `pb tail` command for a given log stream. For example:

```bash
pb tail frontend
```

You can pipe the tail output to other familiar tools like `jq`, `grep`, `cut`, `awk`, `sed` etc to process the JSON output. For example:

```bash
pb tail frontend | jq . | less
pb tail frontend | grep "POST" | jq . | less
pb tail frontend | jq '. | select(.method == "PATCH")'
```
