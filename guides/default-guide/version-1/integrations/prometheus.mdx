Prometheus offers a multi-dimensional data model with time series data identified by metric name and key/value pairs. The data collection happens via a pull model over HTTP/HTTPS.

Parseable server exposes Prometheus metrics at `/api/v1/metrics` endpoint (unauthorized). The metrics are exposed in [Prometheus exposition format](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/).

### Prerequisites

- Parseable server installed and running. See [installation guide](https://www.parseable.com/docs/category/installation) for more details.
- Prometheus installed and running. See [installation guide](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/) for more details.

### Configuration

Prometheus configuration is done via a YAML file. Locate your Prometheus configuration file `prometheus.yml` and add the following section to scrape Parseable server metrics.

```yaml
scrape_configs:
- job_name: parseable-job
  metrics_path: /api/v1/metrics
  scheme: http
  static_configs:
  - targets: ['localhost:8000']
```

Make sure to replace `localhost:8000` with the actual host and port where Parseable server is running.
