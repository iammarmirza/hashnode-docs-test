## Standalone Cluster

The standalone installation method is the quickest to install DeepSource Enterprise Server. If you have the required permissions, you should be able to run your first analysis within 20 minutes. No prior knowledge of bootstrapping Kubernetes is required for this method as it has an embedded, production-ready Kubernetes distribution packaged with it.

## Existing Kubernetes Cluster

DeepSource Enterprise Server can be installed into your existing Kubernetes cluster. An existing cluster installation method is recommended if you already have a Kubernetes cluster running in production and would like to deploy a DeepSource Enterprise Server.

## Helm

The above-mentioned installation methods are currently configured and managed using KOTS by Replicated, but DeepSource Enterprise Server can now also be installed using Helm package manager.
