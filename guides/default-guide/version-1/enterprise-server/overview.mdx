## System Overview

![](https://files.readme.io/ae767fa-image.png)

DeepSource Enterprise Server comes bundled with a host of services, which can be roughly divided into three categories:

### Application Services

The DeepSource application is served by the application services.

| Service/Component | Description                                                                                                      |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bifrost           | Frontend server                                                                                                  |
| asgard-api        | Backend for the DeepSource GraphQL API service                                                                   |

| atlas             | Orchestrator service that integrates with Kubernetes control plane for analysis, transformer, and Autofix‚Ñ¢Ô∏è jobs |
| janus             | Websocket server for realtime results feedback                                                                   |

### Dependencies

The application services depend on these core services to function.

| Service/Component | Description                                                                         |

| minio             | Object storage for application assets                                               |
| pgbouncer         | Connection pooler for PostgreSQL database connections                               |
| RabbitMQ          | Message Queue. Forms a critical bridge between all DeepSource application services. |
| Redis             | Cache database                                                                      |

### KOTS Services

KOTS services are used to install and manage the DeepSource Enterprise Server installation. These services also enable updates to the system, as well as license management. More information about KOTS can be found [here](https://docs.replicated.com/intro-kots#replicated-kots).

| Service/Component | Description                                                                                  |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| kotsadm           | Admin console to install, configure and manage the DeepSource Enterprise Server installation |
| kurl-proxy        | Proxy service for kotsadm (for standalone cluster installations)                             |
| kotsadm-minio     | Object storage for the KOTS Admin Console (for existing cluster installations)               |
| kotsadm-rqlite    | RQLite database service for KOTS admin console                                               |

## Network connectivity

### Ingress

DeepSource Enterprise Server installation can be kept behind network firewalls with zero-to-limited ingress. Typically, customers keep their installation behind a VPN.

### Egress

On non-airgapped installations, the DeepSource Enterprise Server makes outbound connections to the following:

1. Our image registry, through `proxy.replicated.com`
2. The DeepSource Cloud instance, for raising support tickets and reporting false positives
3. Sentry, if enabled

and more. [Here](https://docs.deepsource.com/docs/enterprise-server-requirements#firewall) is an exhaustive list.
