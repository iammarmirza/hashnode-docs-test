Integrating your Azure DevOps Services (ADS) account with DeepSource requires an ADS application. This document outlines the configuration, permission requirements, and app configuration to get started with your ADS account and DeepSource Enterprise.

# Creating an Azure DevOps application

> ðŸš§ Things to note before you proceed
> 
> - Azure doesn't allow access or transfership of an application so it's recommended to create this application using a team or service account.

1. With logged into Azure, visit <https://aex.dev.azure.com/> (or the equivalent URL in your Azure DevOps Server instance).
2. Scroll to the bottom. On the left-hand side, you will find a section titled **"Applications and services"**. Click on the **"Create new application"** under this section. You can also directly visit <https://aex.dev.azure.com/app/register>.
3. You'd be prompted to fill out a form to create a new application. Enter the following details:

> ðŸ“˜ Replace `ORGANIZATION_NAME` with the name of your organization, and `HOSTNAME` with the actual hostname on which you plan to deploy DeepSource to.
