Use the DeepSource GraphQL API to retrieve your data programmatically and easily automate your workflows.

### Endpoint

For DeepSource Cloud:

```
[https://api.deepsource.io/graphql/](https://api.deepsource.io/graphql/)
```

For on-premise deployments:

```
[https://[hostname]/api/graphql/](https://[hostname]/api/graphql/)
```

where `hostname` refers to the hostname of the DeepSource dashboard.

### Authentication

Authenticate via a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](/docs/apis-personal-access-token). You need to pass it as a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl 'https://api.deepsource.io/graphql/' \
-X POST \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
--data '{ "query": "query { viewer { email } }" }'
```

Because GraphQL depends entirely on multiline JSON, we recommend that you use a GraphQL client like [Altair](https://altair.sirmuel.design/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/). Note that the client wouldn't be able to perform requests or fetch the schema/documentation (which facilitates auto-complete) unless you add the `Authorization` header as above.

### Rate Limits

Rate limits define the maximum number of requests a single user account can make within a given period of time. If the rate limit is exceeded, the API responds with an HTTP [429 Too Many Requests](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-nottingham-http-new-status-02#section-4) response code.

Rate limits are applied at the user level and calculated across both read and write operations.

Currently, we enforce a flat rate limit of `5,000` requests per hour.
