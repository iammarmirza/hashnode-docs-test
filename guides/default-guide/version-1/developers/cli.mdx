# Installation

### Homebrew

- To install the DeepSource CLI with [homebrew](https://brew.sh), run:

```shell
brew install deepsourcelabs/cli/deepsource
```

### Unix

- To directly install the CLI as a binary, run:

```shell
curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh
```

This script will detect the operating system and architecture and puts `deepsource` binary in `./bin/deepsource`. You can set a custom location for the CLI installation script to download the binary to using an environment variable, `BINDIR`. The default location is `./.bin/deepsource` (the `.bin` directory will be created if it doesn't already exist).

This can be helpful when you want the CLI to be installed to a directory in the `PATH`, like `~/.local/bin` or `/usr/local/bin` to make it accessible from anywhere:

```shell
BINDIR=~/.local/bin curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh
```

### Windows

- Download compressed binary [here](https://github.com/deepsourcelabs/cli/releases/download/v0.5.0/deepsource_0.5.0_windows_x86_64.tar.gz).
- Decompress the binary.
- To invoke the binary, run:

```shell
.\deepsource report --analyzer=test-coverage --key=go --value-file=coverage.out.
```

The CLI requires that the tests are run inside a git repo, and that the git binary is installed. TheÂ `DEEPSOURCE_DSN`Â value needs to be set in the environment, too.

### Supported operating systems

- Linux
- Darwin
- Windows
- FreeBSD
- OpenBSD
- NetBSD

### Supported architectures

- i386
- x86_64
- arm64
