Fastlyâ€™s Real-Time Log Streaming feature enables the transmission of log data to an HTTPS endpoint. This guide outlines the steps to configure Fastly to send logs to a Parseable instance via an HTTPS endpoint.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up Fastly to send logs to Parseable, ensure you have the following:

- A Fastly account with logs that you want to push to Parseable.
- An active Parseable instance to receive logs. Refer the [installation docs here](https://www.parseable.com/docs/installation).
- Credentials for the Parseable instance, so you can send requests for ingestion.
- Ensure a stream is created in Parseable where these logs will be sent. Replace the `$LOG_STREAM` placeholder with the actual stream name below.

### Validate Domain Ownership

Fastly requires that you have validated ownership of the domain specified in the URL field (for log target). Review the [Fastly documentation](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/log-streaming-https#prerequisites) for more information on domain validation.

To validate your Parseable endpoint as a logging target, you'll need to add a load balancer or proxy in front of your Parseable instance. So Fastly can verify the SHA challenge.

### Adding HTTPS as a Logging Endpoint

To configure Fastly to send logs to your Parseable instance, follow these steps:

- Navigate to Log streaming settings: Log in to your Fastly account and access the log streaming configuration section.

- Create a new HTTPS endpoint: In the HTTPS logging section, click on Create endpoint.
   
- Configure the HTTPS Endpoint:
   - Name: Enter a recognizable name for this logging endpoint.
   - Placement: Select where the logging call should be placed in the VCL. You can choose from options like `Format Version Default`, `waf_debug`, or `None`. Refer to [Fastly documentation on log placement](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/changing-log-placement).
   - Log format: Optionally, you can define how the logs should be formatted using an Apache-style string or VCL variables. For example:
   
     ```plaintext
     {
       "timestamp": "%{strftime({"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z"}, time.start)}V",
       "client_ip": "%{req.http.Fastly-Client-IP}V",
       "geo_country": "%{client.geo.country_name}V",
       "geo_city": "%{client.geo.city}V",
       "host": "%{if(req.http.Fastly-Orig-Host, req.http.Fastly-Orig-Host, req.http.Host)}V",
       "url": "%{json.escape(req.url)}V",
       "request_method": "%{json.escape(req.method)}V",
       "request_protocol": "%{json.escape(req.proto)}V",
       "request_referer": "%{json.escape(req.http.referer)}V",
       "request_user_agent": "%{json.escape(req.http.User-Agent)}V",
       "response_state": "%{json.escape(fastly_info.state)}V",
       "response_status": %{resp.status}V,
       "response_reason": %{if(resp.response, "%22"+json.escape(resp.response)+"%22", "null")}V,
       "response_body_size": %{resp.body_bytes_written}V,
       "fastly_server": "%{json.escape(server.identity)}V,
       "fastly_is_edge": %{if(fastly.ff.visits_this_service == 0, "true", "false")}V
     }
     ```
   
   - URL: Enter the Parseable HTTPS endpoint URL where the logs will be sent, such as `https://logs.parseable.com/`.
   - Maximum logs (optional): Specify the maximum number of log entries to send in a single batch.
   - Maximum bytes (optional): Set the maximum size of a log batch in bytes.

- Create and Deploy:
   - Click Create to finalize the HTTPS endpoint setup.
   - Finally, click Activate to deploy these changes and start streaming logs to the specified endpoint.
