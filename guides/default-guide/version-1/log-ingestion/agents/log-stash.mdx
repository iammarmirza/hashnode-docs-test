Logstash is a server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from a multitude of sources, transforms it, and then sends it to variety of targets. Logstash can be configured to send logs to Parseable with [HTTP output plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-outputs-http.html) and JSON output format.

This document explains how to set up Logstash to ship logs to Parseable in Docker Compose. We use Logstash's `generator` input plugin to generate sample log data. Then we use the `http` output plugin to send these logs to Parseable.

## Docker Compose

Please ensure Docker Compose [installed on your machine](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

```bash
mkdir parseable
cd parseable
wget https://www.parseable.com/logstash/logstash.conf
wget https://www.parseable.com/logstash/docker-compose.yaml
docker-compose up -d
```

You can now access the Parseable dashboard on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). You should see a log stream called `logstashlogs` populated with log data generated by the generator output plugin.
