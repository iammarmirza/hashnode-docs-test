## Which languages are supported?

Refer to the [list of supported analyzers](https://docs.deepsource.com/docs/analyzers#supported-analyzers) for the complete list of supported analyzers.

## Which source code hosting providers are supported?

Refer to the [list of supported providers](https://docs.deepsource.com/docs/quickstart-create-an-account) for the complete list of supported Source Code hosting providers.

## Do I need to pay for my open-source projects?

No. DeepSource is free to use for public repositories.

## What are the available modes of payment?

For non-Enterprise plans, we accept payment via credit cards in USD.

For Enterprise plans, we can do manual invoicing. Contact your account manager (or) [sales@deepsource.io](mailto:sales@deepsource.io) if you have any questions about invoicing.

## Why do you require write permission for a single file?

When granting permissions, we request access only to a single file â€” `.deepsource.toml`. We can't write to any other file with this permission except the pre-defined `.deepsource.toml`. We are working with providers like GitHub to make this clearer on their installation page.

## What VCS permissions does DeepSource need?

All the required VCS permissions are listed in [Permissions](https://docs.deepsource.com/docs/help-permissions).

## What IP ranges do I have to allow if I am implementing an allowlist for my version control system (VCS)?

You have to allow the following IP ranges `35.225.112.198/32`,`34.42.70.44/32` and `104.154.172.152/32` through your firewall when using DeepSource's cloud offering.
