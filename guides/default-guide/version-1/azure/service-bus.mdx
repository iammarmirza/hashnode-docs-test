Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise integration message broker. Service Bus is most commonly used to decouple applications and services from each other, and is a reliable and secure platform for asynchronous data and state transfer.

Service Bus is used to decouple applications and services from each other, providing the following benefits:

- Load-balancing work across competing workers
- Safely routing and transferring data and control across service and application boundaries
- Coordinating transactional work that requires a high-degree of reliability

### Overview

You can send messages published to Azure Service Bus Queue to Parseable [Azure Logic Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview) service. 

We'll use the Azure Logic Apps trigger "When a message is received in a queue" to send message to Parseable.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need the following:

- Parseable deployed and running in your environment. Refer the [installation](https://www.parseable.com/docs/category/installation) guide for more information.
- Active Azure subscription with Service Bus namespace and queue created. Refer the [Azure Service Bus](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-quickstart-portal) documentation for more information.
