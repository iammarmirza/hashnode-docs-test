# .deepsource.toml

The analysis configuration for a repository on DeepSource is defined in a `.deepsource.toml` file in the repository's root. This file must be present at the said location for analysis to be run.

```toml TOML
.
├── .deepsource.toml
├── README.md
├── bar
│   └── baz.py
└── foo.py
```

The configuration is written in the [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) format.

## `version`

- **Type:** Integer
- **Presence:** mandatory
- **Description:** The version property is required and must be set to 1, which is the only supported version at the moment.

```toml
version = 1
```

## `exclude_patterns`

- **Type:** Array
- **Presence:** optional
- **Description:** List of glob patterns that should be excluded when the analyses are run. These patterns should be relative to the repository's root.
- Example:

```toml
exclude_patterns = [  
  "bin/**",  
  "**/node_modules/",  
  "js/**/*.min.js"  
]
```

## `test_patterns`

- **Type:** Array
- **Presence:** optional
- **Description:** List of glob patterns that should be marked as tests or containing test files. These patterns should be relative to the repository's root.

]
```

## `analyzers`

- **Type:** Array of Tables
- **Presence:** mandatory

```toml
[[analyzers]]  
name = "python"  
enabled = true  
dependency_file_paths = [  
  "requirements.txt",  
  "Pipfile"  
]
```

The configuration must have at least one valid Analyzer enabled for the analysis to run.
