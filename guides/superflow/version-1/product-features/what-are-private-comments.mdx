## What are Private Comments?

Private comments are comments that are visible to you and admin users. These types of comments will appear as comment icons with Lock indicators. Commenters and Guest users will not be able to access or read these private comments.

See [How to Add Private Comments](https://docs.usesuperflow.com/how-to-guides/how-to-add-private-comments) for more information.
