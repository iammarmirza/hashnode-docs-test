In this article, you will learn how to invite users to your project. There are two (2) types of users, the Admin and Commenters. It is worth noting that these types of users have different functions and access to features.

Access the Superflow Dashboard by going to [app.usesuperflow.com](app.usesuperflow.com). Alternatively, when you are in Review Mode, you can use the method below:

1. Find the **Superflow Toolbar** and click the **More Options** icon.
