## 7) Troubleshooting

Having trouble getting your verifying your installation? Here are the common mistakes users encounter when installing Superflow:

 - Did you forget to save the Custom Code?
 - Did you forget to publish your site?
 - Is the browser still loading a cached version?
 - Did you add `?review=true` at the end of your url?
 - Did you publish your changes on a staging URL while you are trying to access a Prod URL?
 - Did you accidentally install multiple Superflow scripts in the Custom Code?


## 8) Navigate to your Shopify site 

Now that you have verified that Superflow has been installed on your Shopify site, navigate to your published site and add `?review=true` at the end of the URL to enable Superflow. 

`Example: mywebsite.shopify.com/?review=true`

If you are unsure, what your Shopify site URL is, you can click the Preview button at the top right of the Themes settings page.
