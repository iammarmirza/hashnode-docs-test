## 7) Troubleshooting

Having trouble getting your verifying your installation? Here are the common mistakes users encounter when installing Superflow:

 - Did you forget to save the Custom Code?
 - Did you forget to publish your site?

## 8) Navigate to your site 

Now that you have verified that Superflow has been installed on your site, navigate to your published site and add `?review=true` at the end of the URL to enable Superflow. 

`Example: mywebsite.yoursite.com/?review=true`
