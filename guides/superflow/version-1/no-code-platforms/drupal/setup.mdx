## 7) Troubleshooting

Having trouble getting your verifying your installation? Here are the common mistakes users encounter when installing Superflow:

 - Did you forget to save the Custom Code?
 - Did you forget to publish your site?
 - Is the browser still loading a cached version?
 - Did you add `?review=true` at the end of your url?
 - Did you publish your changes on a staging URL while you are trying to access a Prod URL?
 - Did you accidentally install multiple Superflow scripts in the Custom Code?
 - Ensure that your website changes have actually been published. You should see be able to see Superflow JS tag in your dev console DOM tree.
 - Sometimes the browser is loading the older cached version of your website, so check if you are able to see the Superflow script tag.
 - If you still don’t see the toolbar at the bottom right of your website, open dev console to see if there are any errors from Superflow?

## 8) Navigate to your Drupal site 

Now that you have verified that Superflow has been installed on your Drupal site, navigate to your published site and add `?review=true` at the end of the URL to enable Superflow. 

`Example: mywebsite.drupal.com/?review=true`


## 9) Test out Superflow

You should now see a Superflow toolbar on the bottom right of you screen.
