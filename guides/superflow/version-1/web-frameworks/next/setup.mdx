## 4) Install the Superflow NPM package

Install the Superflow NPM package with:

```
npm i @usesuperflow/client
```

## 5) Import Superflow into your `page.tsx` file

Import the Superflow NPM package with:

```
import { initSuperflow } from '@usesuperflow/client'
```


## 6) Initialize Superflow within `page.tsx`

Import `initSuperflow` from the NPM package and use it to initialize Superflow.

Create a `useEffect` hook and paste in the unique Superflow code you copied earlier.

Be sure to add `"use client"` at the top of your `page.tsx` file to enable client side data-fetching.

```js
"use client";

import Image from 'next/image'
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import { initSuperflow } from '@usesuperflow/client'

export default function Home() {

useEffect(()=>{
  //initialize Superflow
  initSuperflow('YOUR_API_KEY', {
    projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'
  });

})
return (
  <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
    <div className="z-10 max-w-5xl w-full items-center justify-between font-mono text-sm lg:flex">
      <p className="text-xl fixed left-0 top-0 flex w-full justify-center border-b border-gray-300 bg-gradient-to-b from-zinc-200 pb-6 pt-8 backdrop-blur-2xl dark:border-neutral-800 dark:bg-zinc-800/30 dark:from-inherit lg:static lg:w-auto  lg:rounded-xl lg:border lg:bg-gray-200 lg:p-4 lg:dark:bg-zinc-800/30">

## 9) Troubleshooting

Having trouble getting your verifying your installation? Here are the common mistakes users encounter when installing Superflow:

 - Did you forget to save the Custom Code?
 - Did you forget to publish your site?
 - Is the browser still loading a cached version?
 - Did you add `?review=true` at the end of your url?
 - Did you publish your changes on a staging URL while you are trying to access a Prod URL?
 - Did you accidentally install multiple Superflow scripts in the Custom Code?


## 10) Navigate to your Next site 

Now that you have verified that Superflow has been installed on your Next site, navigate to your published site and add `?review=true` at the end of the URL to enable Superflow. 

`Example: mywebsite.com/?review=true`


## 11) Test out Superflow

You should now see a Superflow toolbar on the bottom right of your screen.
