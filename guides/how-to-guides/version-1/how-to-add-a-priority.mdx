## How to Add a Priority

In this article, you will learn how to add a priority. There are three (3) levels of priorities starting at P0, P1, and P2. There are a couple of ways to add priorities, either by creating a comment and adding a priority or adding priority to an existing comment. In this example, we will use the latter.

1. On the screen, find and click the **Comment** that you want to update.
