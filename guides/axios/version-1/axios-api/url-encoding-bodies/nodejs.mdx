**Query string**
In node.js, you can use the `querystring` module as follows:

```js
const querystring = require('querystring');
axios.post('http://something.com/', querystring.stringify({ foo: 'bar' }));
```

or 'URLSearchParams' from 'url module' as follows:

```js
const url = require('url');
const params = new url.URLSearchParams({ foo: 'bar' });
axios.post('http://something.com/', params.toString());
```

You can also use the `qs` library.

> Note: The `qs` library is preferable if you need to stringify nested objects, as the `querystring` method has known issues with that use case https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/1665.
