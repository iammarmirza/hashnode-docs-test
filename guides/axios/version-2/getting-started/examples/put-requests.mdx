The **PUT** request method is used to update an existing resource or to create a resource if it does not exist on the server. In the context of RESTful APIs, **PUT** requests are typically used for updating entire resources.

## Basic `PUT` Request

In Axios, a `PUT` request can be made using the `axios.put()` method. The method requires the URL of the resource to be updated and the data to be sent to the server.

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const updateUser = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.put('https://api.example.com/users/123', {
      name: 'John Doe',
      email: 'john.doe@example.com'
    });
    console.log('User updated:', response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error updating user:', error);
  }
};

updateUser();
```
In this example, a `PUT` request is made to update user data. The response.data contains the updated resource returned by the server.

## `PUT` Request with Headers
Sometimes, additional headers, such as authentication tokens, need to be included in the PUT request. This can be done using the headers option.

```js
axios.put('https://api.example.com/users/123', {
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john.doe@example.com'
}, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'Bearer your_token_here'
  }
})
.then(response => {
  console.log('User updated:', response.data);
})
.catch(error => {
  console.error('Error updating user:', error);
});
```
In this case, a Bearer token is passed in the request headers to authenticate the update operation.
