Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. It is isomorphic (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase). On the server-side it uses the native node.js http module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.

## Features
- Make XMLHttpRequests from the browser
- Make http requests from node.js
- Supports the Promise API
- Intercept request and response
- Transform request and response data
- Cancel requests
- Timeouts
- Query parameters serialization with support for nested entries
- Automatic request body serialization to:
  - JSON (`application/json`)
  - Multipart / FormData (`multipart/form-data`)
  - URL encoded form (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`)
- Posting HTML forms as JSON
- Automatic JSON data handling in response
- Progress capturing for browsers and node.js with extra info (speed rate, remaining time)
- Setting bandwidth limits for node.js
- Compatible with spec-compliant FormData and Blob (including node.js)
- Client side support for protecting against XSRF
