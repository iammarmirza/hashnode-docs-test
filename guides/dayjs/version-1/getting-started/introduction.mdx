Day.js is a minimalist JavaScript library for working with dates and times. It offers a small and fast alternative to larger date libraries while maintaining modern functionality. Day.js is heavily inspired by [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/), a popular date library that is no longer actively maintained.

Day.js is widely used for date formatting, manipulation, comparison, and parsing, offering flexibility while remaining performant.
