Day.js is designed to be immutable, however, in order to make it fully compatible with moment.js in some legacy projects we introduced a plugin ğŸš¨ BadMutable ğŸš¨ to make Day.js mutable.

<Callout type="warning">
This is **NOT** good and **NOT** recommended for most projects.
</Callout>

With this plugin enabled, all setters will update the instance itself.

```javascript
var badMutable = require("dayjs/plugin/badMutable");
// import badMutable from 'dayjs/plugin/badMutable' // ES 2015

dayjs.extend(badMutable);
// with ğŸš¨ BadMutable ğŸš¨ plugin
const today = dayjs();
today.add(1, "day");
console.log(today); // update itself, value will be tomorrow
```
