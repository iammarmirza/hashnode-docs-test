This indicates whether the Day.js object is the same or after another supplied date-time.

> This requires the **`IsSameOrAfter`** plugin to work.

```js
dayjs.extend(isSameOrAfter)
dayjs().isSameOrAfter(dayjs('2011-01-01')) // default milliseconds
```
If you want to limit the granularity to a unit other than milliseconds, pass it as the second parameter.

```js
dayjs().isSameOrAfter('2011-01-01', 'year')
```

Units are case insensitive, and support plural and short forms.
