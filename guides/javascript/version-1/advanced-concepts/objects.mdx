Objects in JavaScript are collections of properties, where each property is a key-value pair. Keys are strings (or symbols), and values can be of any type, including other objects or functions.

**Example**:
```js
const person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 30,
    greet: function() {
        console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.firstName);
    }
};

person.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John
```
In this example, the `person` object has properties `firstName`, `lastName`, `age`, and a method `greet` that prints a greeting message using the object's `firstName`.

### Key Features of Objects:
- **Properties**: Values associated with a key, which can be any data type.
- **Methods**: Functions stored as properties of objects.

### Accessing Object Properties:
- **Dot notation**: person.firstName
- **Bracket notation**: person['lastName']

Objects are a flexible and powerful way to structure data, and they are used extensively in JavaScript for representing entities and handling data.
