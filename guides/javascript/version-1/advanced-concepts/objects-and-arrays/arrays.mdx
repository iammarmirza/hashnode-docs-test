Arrays are used to store ordered lists of data. Each item in an array is indexed starting from zero. JavaScript arrays are dynamic, meaning you can add, remove, and manipulate elements easily.

**Example**:
```js
const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40];
console.log(numbers[0]); // Output: 10
```

In this example, we created an array of numbers and accessed the first element using its index.

**Key Features of Arrays**:
- **Length**: The number of elements in the array (numbers.length).
- **Indexing**: Access elements using their position in the array.
- **Mutability**: Arrays can be modified (adding/removing elements) dynamically.
