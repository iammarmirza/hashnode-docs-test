Object destructuring is a syntax in JavaScript that allows you to extract specific properties from an object and assign them to variables.

**Example**:
```js
const user = { name: "Jane", age: 28, email: "jane@example.com" };
const { name, age } = user;
console.log(name); // Output: Jane
console.log(age); // Output: 28
```
In this example, the `name` and `age` properties of the `user` object are destructured and stored in separate variables.

**Destructuring can also be used with nested objects**:
```js
const person = {
    name: "Sarah",
    address: {
        city: "New York",
        zipCode: 10001
    }
};

const { name, address: { city } } = person;
console.log(city); // Output: New York
```
Destructuring simplifies the process of extracting multiple properties from an object, making your code more readable and concise.
