The `do...while` loop is similar to the `while` loop but ensures that the block of code is executed at least once before the condition is tested. This is useful in scenarios where you want to execute code before checking the condition.

**Syntax**:
```js
do {
    // code to be executed
} while (condition);
```

**Example**:
```js
let count = 0;
do {
    console.log(count);
    count++;
} while (count < 5);
// Output: 
// 0
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
```
In this example, the loop prints the value of `count` and increments it, running the block of code until `count` is no longer less than 5.
