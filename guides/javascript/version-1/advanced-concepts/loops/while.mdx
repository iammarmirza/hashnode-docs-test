The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition evaluates to `true`. It is essential to ensure that the condition will eventually become `false`; otherwise, you may create an infinite loop.

**Syntax:**
```js
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

**Example**:
```js
let count = 0;
while (count < 5) {
    console.log(count);
    count++;
}
// Output: 
// 0
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
```
In this example, the loop continues to execute as long as `count` is less than 5, printing the value of `count` and incrementing it in each iteration.
