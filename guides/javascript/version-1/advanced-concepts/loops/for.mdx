The `for` loop is a control structure that allows you to initialize a counter, set a condition for continuation, and increment the counter in a single line. It is widely used for iterating over arrays or executing a block of code a specific number of times.

**Syntax**:
```js
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

**Example**:
```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
// Output: 
// 0
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
```
In this example, the loop runs 5 times, with `i` starting at 0 and incrementing by 1 until it reaches 5.
