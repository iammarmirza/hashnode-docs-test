The `for...in` loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object. It is important to note that it is not recommended to use `for...in` with arrays, as it iterates over all enumerable properties, including those inherited from the prototype chain.

**Syntax**:
```js
for (const key in object) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

**Example**:
```js
const person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    city: "New York"
};

for (const key in person) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${person[key]}`);
}
// Output:
// name: John
// age: 30
// city: New York
```
In this example, the loop iterates over the keys of `the person` object, logging both the key and its corresponding value.
