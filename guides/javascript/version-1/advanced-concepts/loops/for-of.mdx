The `for...of` loop is a modern iteration statement that allows you to iterate over iterable objects such as arrays, strings, and other collections. It provides a simpler syntax compared to traditional loops.

**Syntax**:
```js
for (const element of iterable) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

**Example**:
```js
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
for (const fruit of fruits) {
    console.log(fruit);
}
// Output: 
// apple
// banana
// orange
```
In this example, the loop iterates over each fruit in the `fruits` array, printing each fruit to the console.
