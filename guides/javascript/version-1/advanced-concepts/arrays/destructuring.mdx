Array destructuring is a syntax that allows you to extract values from an array and assign them to variables.

**Example**:
```js
const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
const [firstColor, secondColor] = colors;
console.log(firstColor); // Output: red
console.log(secondColor); // Output: green
```

In this example, we extracted the first two elements from the `colors` array and assigned them to variables `firstColor` and `secondColor`.

You can also skip elements when destructuring:
```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const [ , , thirdNumber] = numbers;
console.log(thirdNumber); // Output: 3
```

Additionally, destructuring can be used with rest syntax to capture remaining elements in an array:
```js
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"];
const [first, ...others] = fruits;
console.log(first); // Output: apple
console.log(others); // Output: ["banana", "orange", "grape"]
```
Array destructuring makes it easier to work with arrays by allowing you to extract multiple values at once, improving readability and reducing the need for repetitive code.
