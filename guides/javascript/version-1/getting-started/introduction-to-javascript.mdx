JavaScript is a **lightweight**, **interpreted**, or **just-in-time compiled** programming language with first-class functions. It is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it is used in many non-browser environments as well.

JavaScript is a **multi-paradigm** language, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles.
