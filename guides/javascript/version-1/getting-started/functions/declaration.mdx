## Function Declaration:
A function declaration defines a named function and is hoisted to the top of its scope, meaning it can be called before it is defined.

**Example**:
```js
function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}

sayHello(); // Output: Hello, world!
```
In this example, the `sayHello` function is defined using a function declaration. Because of hoisting, it can be called even before the line where it is defined.

## Function Expression:
A function expression is a function assigned to a variable. Unlike function declarations, function expressions are not hoisted, meaning they cannot be called before they are defined.

**Example**:
```js
const greet = function() {
    console.log("Greetings!");
};

greet(); // Output: Greetings!
```
Here, the function is stored in a variable `greet` and can be called using that variable.

### Key Differences:
- **Hoisting**: Function declarations are hoisted, while function expressions are not.
- **Syntax**: Function declarations start with the `function` keyword, while function expressions can be anonymous or named.
- **Usage**: Function declarations are used when the function needs to be called before it is defined, while function expressions are used when the function is assigned to a variable or passed as an argument to another function.
