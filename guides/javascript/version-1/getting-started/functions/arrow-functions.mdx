Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax for writing function expressions. They are particularly useful for anonymous functions and have a different behavior with regard to the this keyword compared to regular functions.

Example of a regular function:
```js
const multiply = function(a, b) {
    return a * b;
};
console.log(multiply(3, 4)); // Output: 12
```

Example of an arrow function:
```js
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
console.log(multiply(3, 4)); // Output: 12
```

### Key Features of Arrow Functions:
- **Concise syntax**: They allow for shorter and more readable code.
- **Implicit return**: If the function body is a single expression, the return keyword can be omitted.
- **Lexical this**: Arrow functions do not have their own this context. Instead, they inherit this from the enclosing scope, which is useful in certain contexts like event handling.

Example with implicit return:
```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(5, 7)); // Output: 12
```
Arrow functions are especially useful in array methods like map, filter, and reduce.
