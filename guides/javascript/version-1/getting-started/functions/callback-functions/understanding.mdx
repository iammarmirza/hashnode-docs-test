Callbacks are essential for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. Instead of waiting for a task to complete, the program can continue executing, and the callback is invoked once the task is finished.

A common use case of callbacks is handling API requests. JavaScript can make a request to a server, and when the data is returned (which may take some time), a callback function processes the data.

**Example**:
```js
function getData(callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        const data = "Some fetched data";
        callback(data);
    }, 3000);
}

getData(function(result) {
    console.log("Received data: " + result);
});
```
Here, `getData` fetches data after a 3-second delay and then calls the callback function to handle the received data.

Callbacks are also used in event-driven programming. For example, when a button is clicked, a callback function can handle what happens next.
