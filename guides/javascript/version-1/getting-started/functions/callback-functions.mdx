A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of that function. This is a powerful concept in JavaScript, particularly when working with asynchronous code.

Example:
```js
function fetchData(callback) {
    console.log("Fetching data...");
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Data fetched!");
        callback();
    }, 2000);
}

function processData() {
    console.log("Processing data...");
}

fetchData(processData);
```
In this example, fetchData simulates fetching data with a delay, and once the data is fetched, it calls the processData function.
