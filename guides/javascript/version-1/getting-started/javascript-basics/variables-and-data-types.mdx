In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manipulate data. A variable acts as a container for storing values, which can be used and changed throughout your program. Understanding variables and data types is essential to working with JavaScript.

## Declaring Variables

JavaScript provides three ways to declare variables:

- **`var`**: An older way of declaring variables. It is function-scoped and allows for redeclaration.
- **`let`**: Introduced in ES6, `let` is block-scoped, meaning it is confined to the block in which it is declared.
- **`const`**: Also introduced in ES6, `const` is used to declare variables that are not intended to be reassigned. It is block-scoped like `let`.

```js
var x = 10; // Using var
let y = 20; // Using let
const z = 30; // Using const
```
### Differences Between var, let, and const

Scope: var is function-scoped, while let and const are block-scoped (limited to the block {} in which they are declared).
Reassignment: Variables declared with let can be reassigned, while variables declared with const cannot.

```js
let a = 10;
a = 20; // This is allowed

const b = 30;
b = 40; // Error: Assignment to constant variable
```

### JavaScript Data Types
JavaScript has several built-in data types, which are categorized into two main types: primitive and non-primitive (reference types).

Primitive Data Types
Primitive data types are the most basic data types in JavaScript. These include:

Number: Represents numeric values, both integers and floating-point numbers.
``` js
let age = 25;
let price = 99.99;
```
* String: Represents textual data enclosed in quotes (single, double, or backticks).

```js
let name = 'Alice';
let greeting = "Hello, world!";
```

* Boolean: Represents a logical value, either true or false.

```js
let isActive = true;
let isComplete = false;
```

* Undefined: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value has the value undefined.

```js
let myVar;
console.log(myVar); // Outputs: undefined
```

* Null: Represents an intentionally empty value.

```js
let emptyValue = null;
```

* Symbol: A unique and immutable value, often used as identifiers for object properties. Symbols are a more advanced feature.

```js
let sym = Symbol('description');
```

* BigInt: A new data type introduced in ES2020, used for working with integers larger than the Number type can safely handle.

```js
let bigNumber = BigInt(12345678901234567890);
```

* Non-Primitive Data Types (Reference Types)
The most common reference types are objects and arrays. These are not stored directly in the variable but rather by reference.

* Object: A collection of key-value pairs, where values can be any data type.

```js
let person = {
  name: 'Bob',
  age: 30
};
```

* Array: An ordered collection of values. Arrays are objects under the hood, but they have a special syntax and methods for managing lists of data.

```js
let colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
```

### Type Coercion
JavaScript is a loosely typed language, which means that it automatically converts one data type to another when needed, a process known as type coercion. This can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior:

```js
let result = '5' + 10; // '510' - JavaScript converts the number to a string
let sum = '5' - 2; // 3 - JavaScript converts the string to a number
```
### Checking Data Types
You can check the type of a variable using the typeof operator:

```js
let x = 42;
console.log(typeof x); // Outputs: number

let y = 'hello';
console.log(typeof y); // Outputs: string
```

### Dynamic Typing
In JavaScript, a variable's type can change at runtime. This is known as dynamic typing:

```js
let value = 100; // Initially a number
value = 'A hundred'; // Now a string
```
