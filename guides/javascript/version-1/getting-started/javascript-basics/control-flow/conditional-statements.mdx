In JavaScript, **conditional statements** allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. This helps control the flow of the program by making decisions at runtime.

## Types of Conditional Statements

### 1. `if` Statement

The **`if`** statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is `true`.

```js
let age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
}
```
If the condition evaluates to true, the code inside the if block runs.

### 2. `if...else` Statement
The **`if...else`** statement executes one block of code if the condition is true and another block if it is false.

```js
let age = 16;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
  console.log("You are a minor.");
}
```

### 3. `else if` Statement
You can use **`else if`** to check multiple conditions in sequence. The first true condition will trigger its corresponding block of code.

```js
let score = 85;

if (score >= 90) {
  console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (score >= 80) {
  console.log("Grade: B");
} else {
  console.log("Grade: C");
}
```

### 4. Ternary Operator (?)
The ternary operator provides a concise way to write **`if...else`** statements. It evaluates a condition and returns one value if true, and another if false.

```js
let age = 20;
let message = (age >= 18) ? "You can vote." : "You cannot vote.";
console.log(message); // Outputs: "You can vote."
```
