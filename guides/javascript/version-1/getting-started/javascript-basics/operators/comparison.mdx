In JavaScript, **comparison operators** are used to compare two values. They return a boolean (`true` or `false`) based on whether the comparison is true.

## Types of Comparison Operators

### 1. Equal (`==`)

Compares if two values are equal, after type coercion (automatic conversion of data types).

```js
console.log(5 == '5'); // true
```

### 2. Strict Equal (===)
Checks if two values are equal and of the same type (no type coercion).

```js
console.log(5 === '5'); // false
```

### 3. Not Equal (!=)
Compares if two values are not equal, with type coercion.

```js
console.log(5 != '5'); // false
```

### 4. Strict Not Equal (!==)
Checks if two values are not equal or not of the same type.

```js
console.log(5 !== '5'); // true
```

### 5. Greater Than (>)
Returns true if the value on the left is greater than the one on the right.

```js
console.log(10 > 5); // true
```

### 6. Greater Than or Equal (>=)
Returns true if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the one on the right.

```js
console.log(10 >= 10); // true
```

### 7. Less Than (`<`)
Returns true if the value on the left is less than the one on the right.

```js
console.log(5 < 10); // true
```

### 8. Less Than or Equal (`<=`)
Returns true if the value on the left is less than or equal to the one on the right.

```js
console.log(5 <= 5); // true
```

## Comparing Different Data Types
JavaScript can perform type coercion when comparing different data types. This means it may convert one or both values before comparison.

```js
console.log('5' == 5); // true, '5' is coerced into a number
```
To avoid unexpected results, it's recommended to use strict equality (===) and strict inequality (!==) to prevent type coercion.
