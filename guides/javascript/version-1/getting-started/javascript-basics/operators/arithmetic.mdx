# Arithmetic Operators

In JavaScript, **arithmetic operators** are used to perform basic mathematical operations on numbers. These operators allow you to manipulate numerical values and are fundamental to many programming tasks.

## Types of Arithmetic Operators

JavaScript provides several arithmetic operators for performing different mathematical calculations. Let's look at each of them:

### 1. Addition (`+`)

The **addition operator** is used to add two values together.

```js
let sum = 10 + 5;
console.log(sum); // Outputs: 15
```
You can also use the addition operator to concatenate strings:

```js
let message = 'Hello' + ' ' + 'World';
console.log(message); // Outputs: Hello World
```

### 2. Subtraction (-)
The subtraction operator subtracts one number from another.

```js
let difference = 10 - 5;
console.log(difference); // Outputs: 5
```

### 3. Multiplication (*)
The multiplication operator multiplies two numbers.

```js
let product = 10 * 5;
console.log(product); // Outputs: 50
```

### 4. Division (/)
The division operator divides one number by another.

```js
let quotient = 10 / 2;
console.log(quotient); // Outputs: 5
```

### 5. Remainder/Modulus (%)
The remainder operator (also known as the modulus operator) returns the remainder after dividing one number by another.

```js
let remainder = 10 % 3;
console.log(remainder); // Outputs: 1
```

### 6. Exponentiation (**)
The exponentiation operator raises the first number to the power of the second number.

```js
let power = 2 ** 3;
console.log(power); // Outputs: 8
```

This is equivalent to Math.pow(2, 3).

### 7. Increment (++)
The increment operator increases the value of a variable by 1.

* Post-increment: Returns the original value, then increments.

```js
let a = 5;
console.log(a++); // Outputs: 5
console.log(a);   // Outputs: 6
```

* Pre-increment: Increments the value first, then returns the new value.

```js
let b = 5;
console.log(++b); // Outputs: 6
```

### 8. Decrement (--)
The decrement operator decreases the value of a variable by 1.

Post-decrement: Returns the original value, then decrements.

```js
let x = 5;
console.log(x--); // Outputs: 5
console.log(x);   // Outputs: 4
```

Pre-decrement: Decrements the value first, then returns the new value.

```js
let y = 5;
console.log(--y); // Outputs: 4
```

## Operator Precedence
Operator precedence determines the order in which operations are performed. JavaScript follows the standard order of operations (also known as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction).

```js
let result = 10 + 5 * 2;
console.log(result); // Outputs: 20, not 30
```
In the above example, multiplication is performed before addition. You can change the order of operations by using parentheses:

```js
let result = (10 + 5) * 2;
console.log(result); // Outputs: 30
```

## Type Coercion with Arithmetic Operators
JavaScript can sometimes convert (or "coerce") values into different types when using arithmetic operators, especially when dealing with strings and numbers.

Adding a number to a string will result in string concatenation:

```js
let result = '5' + 2;
console.log(result); // Outputs: '52'
```

Other arithmetic operations (such as subtraction or multiplication) will attempt to convert the string to a number:

```js
let result = '5' - 2;
console.log(result); // Outputs: 3
```
