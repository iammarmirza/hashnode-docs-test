In JavaScript, **logical operators** are used to combine or invert conditions and return a boolean result (`true` or `false`). They are often used in conditional statements and loops to control the flow of a program.

## Types of Logical Operators

### 1. Logical AND (`&&`)

The **AND** operator returns `true` if **both** conditions are `true`. If either condition is `false`, it returns `false`.

```js
console.log(true && true);  // true
console.log(true && false); // false
```
This operator is useful when you want to check that multiple conditions are met.

```js
let age = 25;
let hasLicense = true;

if (age >= 18 && hasLicense) {
  console.log("You can drive.");
} else {
  console.log("You cannot drive.");
}
```

### 2. Logical OR (||)
The OR operator returns true if at least one of the conditions is true. It only returns false when both conditions are false.

```js
console.log(true || false);  // true
console.log(false || false); // false
```
This is helpful when you want to execute code if any one of the conditions is met.

```js
let isWeekend = true;
let isHoliday = false;

if (isWeekend || isHoliday) {
  console.log("You can relax.");
} else {
  console.log("You have to work.");
}
```

### 3. Logical NOT (!)
The NOT operator inverts a boolean value. It returns true if the condition is false, and vice versa.

```js
console.log(!true);  // false
console.log(!false); // true
```
This is useful when you need to check for the opposite of a condition.

```js
let isRaining = false;

if (!isRaining) {
  console.log("You can go outside.");
} else {
  console.log("Better stay indoors.");
}
```

## Short-Circuit Evaluation
Logical operators in JavaScript use short-circuit evaluation. This means that JavaScript stops evaluating as soon as it finds a result:

With &&, if the first condition is false, it stops and returns false.
With ||, if the first condition is true, it stops and returns true.

```js
let name = "";
let defaultName = "Guest";

console.log(name || defaultName); // Outputs: "Guest"
```
Here, the || operator returns the second value because the first one (name) is falsy (empty string).
