In JavaScript, **assignment operators** assign values to variables. Some also perform operations like addition and subtraction during assignment.

## Basic Assignment Operator (`=`)

The simplest operator, `=`, assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.

```js
let x = 10;
console.log(x); // Outputs: 10
```

## Compound Assignment Operators
These combine operations with assignment, saving a step.

### Addition Assignment (+=)

```js
let a = 10;
a += 5; // Equivalent to a = a + 5
console.log(a); // Outputs: 15
```

### Subtraction Assignment (-=)

```js
let b = 10;
b -= 3; // Equivalent to b = b - 3
console.log(b); // Outputs: 7
```

### Multiplication Assignment (*=) and Division Assignment (/=)

```js
let c = 4;
c *= 3; // Equivalent to c = c * 3
console.log(c); // Outputs: 12

let d = 20;
d /= 4; // Equivalent to d = d / 4
console.log(d); // Outputs: 5
```

### Remainder Assignment (%=)

```js
let e = 10;
e %= 3; // Equivalent to e = e % 3
console.log(e); // Outputs: 1
```

### Exponentiation Assignment (**=)

```js
let f = 2;
f **= 3; // Equivalent to f = f ** 3
console.log(f); // Outputs: 8
```

### Using Assignment Operators with Strings
The `+=` operator can also concatenate strings:

```js
Copy code
let message = 'Hello';
message += ' World';
console.log(message); // Outputs: Hello World
```
