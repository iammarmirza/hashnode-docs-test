Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, and it allows you to run JavaScript on the server or outside of a browser. It also comes with **npm** (Node Package Manager), which is used to manage packages and libraries in JavaScript projects.

To install Node.js:

1. Visit the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download and install the latest **LTS (Long-Term Support)** version of Node.js.
3. After installation, verify that Node.js and npm were installed successfully by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
