A code editor is where youâ€™ll write your JavaScript code. There are several great editors available, but here are some of the most popular ones:

- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** (VS Code): A free, open-source editor that is widely used for JavaScript development. It offers features like syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, debugging tools, and many extensions.
- **[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)**: A lightweight and fast editor with powerful features.
- **[Atom](https://atom.io/)**: Another open-source editor with a strong focus on customization and community-contributed packages.

Once you install an editor, you're ready to write JavaScript code. VS Code is highly recommended for its built-in features and extensions ecosystem.
